# Introduction

## Hello Faculty Friends! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Typist's Instructor Micro-Course!

My name's [Matt McInnis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmcinnis/), I'm the founder and creator of Typist. I started Typist to build educational technology that's more advanced, impactful on student success, and importantly, **much easier for everyone to use**. Since using Typist in your class is so simple, you're going to see that learning how to use Typist is simple, too!

I've designed this micro-course to emulate my favourite online learning experiences. Information is broken down into small, consumable chunks. Each topic is followed by either a short quiz to reinforce important concepts, or sometimes an activity where we'll have you do something in Typist. By the end, you'll have your class setup in Typist, an understanding of what you need to do in the first few weeks of the semester, and some great tips from the incredible faculty I've been so fortunate to collaborate with at over 45 colleges!

Good luck! And please reach out to me to say hi!

Matt
