# Post a Note To Your LMS

Now that your classes are created it's time to post a note to your learning management system (LMS, a.k.a. Blackboard, Brightspace, Moodle, etc.). This will help students create their accounts and join your class as quickly as possible, ensuring a smooth start to your semester.

## Sample Note

Please feel free to copy paste the note below! Also, if you'd like to see how students register with Typist (i.e. create their accounts), watch the short video at the bottom of the message below. Be sure to swap the part that says \*\***YOUR CODE HERE\*\*** for your class code!

<blockquote>

We will be using [Typist](https://www.typistapp.ca) to facilitate learning of keyboarding and document production throughout our course. Please purchase a subscription to Typistâ„¢ available for purchase online at: [TypistApp.ca](https://www.typistapp.ca).

After you have created your account and successfully logged in, join our class by using the code: \*\***YOUR CODE HERE\*\***.

If you're having trouble creating your account, please watch the video below for detailed instructions:
