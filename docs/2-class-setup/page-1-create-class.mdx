## Creating Your First Class

Repeat the following procedure for each class you're teaching with Typist. For simplicity, we don't recommend combining sections, although that's ultimately up to you! For example, if you're teaching three sections of Keyboaring 101, we'd recommend creating three separate classes in Typist.

1. Click 'Home' at the top of Typist.
2. In the _Create a class_ box on the right, give your class a name. For example, the name _KEY101 Keyboarding 101 - Section 1 - W32_ will help you differentiate different sections in Typist. You can name your class anything you like!
3. Below where you typed your class name, you may see a Select Class Template option. If you do, select the class template that matches your course. If you don't see this box or if your course is not listed, simply select _My Class Is Not Here_.
4. Click the _Create Class_ button.

## Adding Students

Once you've created your class, Typist will generate a class code (see video). Simply provide this video to your students, and after they create their Typist student accounts they will be prompted to enter this code. Once they do, those students will appear in your class! We'll touch on this a little more in the next section.
