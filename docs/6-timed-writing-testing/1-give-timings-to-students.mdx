1. How to set your defaults (e.x. the duration, pass speed and accuracy).
2. How to test the students in your class.
3. What testing looks like on the student side.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>

    frameBorder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
