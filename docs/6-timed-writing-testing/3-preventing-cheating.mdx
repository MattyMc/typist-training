# Preventing Cheating ðŸ“š

Typist has a number of features to ensure students cannot cheat on a timed writing. As a general procedure, the following will ensure students are unable to cheat:

1. On your grade sheet, give a test only to students who are in class.
2. Walk around the class. Check that students have started and that the name on their screen matches the student at the computer.

If you complete the two steps above, you can be confident in the integrity of your tests!

## Additional Notes

A question we are often asks is if Typist can prevent cheating if students are completing their timings from home. In short, the answer is _no_. The only true way to ensure any measure of acadmic integrity in any course is to supervise students directly.
