# Advanced: Remote Test Links ðŸ“š

This section is _optional_. If you're using Typist for the first time, we'd recommend skipping this page for now.

## Overview

If you're teaching a class where students are not supervised by you during the timed writings tests, you may wish to explore Remote Test Links.

Remote test links allow you to schedule your timings in advance. For example, you could schedule five timings each week for your students before your course even begins. At a high level, it works as follows:

1. You'll generate a remote test link for each timed writing you'd like your students to complete, specifying the due date.
2. Copy the test links from Typist, and paste them into an annoucement inside your LMS.
3. Schedule each announcement in your LMS to release at a specified date in time in the future.

In effect, your LMS manages when the timings are released (through the annoucement feature), and Typist enforces the due date.

## Getting started

If you'd like to use Typist's Remote Test Links, simply click the 'Remote Test Links' button on your grade sheet. From there, you'll be presented with a full tutorial.
